/*mini project 2 about :
a program that allows the user to enter studentsâ€™ names followed by their test scores.

The program shall output the following (assume that a maximum number of students is 20):

- The average score.
- Names of all the students whose test scores are below the average, with an appropriate warning message.
- Highest test score.
- Name of the top student, with an appreciation message.
